# Mean-Comparison-Test-and-Bootstrap-
This code is actually available for making mean comparison test for two o more samples using parametric and non-parametric test and to usint bootstraping methods tools.

Data in this code is corresponding with a fit parameter estimation for two-point correlation functions. In data we have two zones (North and South) samples in witch several subset of data is available.

The main intention is to evaluate if two samples (mean between South and North) can be considered differents samples.
